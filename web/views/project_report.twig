            <p>We generated for you a report based on an analyze of the strings in your module.This report is there in order to ease the work of the translation teams, they often bump into strings that are really alike (for instance the same sentence with a period at the end or not) and have to translate them twice!<br />
                "We hope that you will use this report to unify those strings.</p>
            <p>Here is a list of strings that we identified to be really close or that sounds really alike.</p>
